THERE SHOULD BE A BIG RED SIDEBAR TO THE RIGHT ----><br/>
Inspect and see HTML comments for details.

<!--
 If you change anything in this DOM subtree, you see the red sidebar (good), but the GPU layer is positioned
 incorrectly. It shows up slammed to the left, when it ought to be slammed to the right of the body.
 Only position absolute or relative triggers the issue. Must also have z-index
-->
<div style="z-index: 1;position: relative;">
  <!-- Needs to have non-zero height. Width seems irrelevant. Padding also works here. -->
  <div style="height: 1px;"></div>
</div>

<!-- Change any styles below this comment and the problem "goes away" -->
<!-- 
This IFrame has a simple pulsing dot with a CSS animation. It seems integral to making this break.
IFrame sandboxing, or moving this cross domain doesn't help. 
-->
<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin" 
        style="transform: scale(1, 1) translate(0px, 0px);" src="iframe-contents.html"></iframe>

<!-- 
A negative non-integral left (or margin-left) is required here. As well as position absolute. 
This element must be AFTER the IFrame above.
-->  
<div style="left: -5.23658e+10px;position: absolute;"></div>

<!-- 
This should be visible. But isn't. 
Looking at the layers view, this doesn't even get a GPU layer. 
Unless you poke out any of the inline styles above.
