While traveling in the Kingdom of Arbitraria, you are accused of a heinous crime. Arbitraria decides who's guilty or innocent 
not through a court system, but a board game. It's played on a simple board: a track with sequential spaces numbered 
from 0 to 1,000. The zero space is marked "start," and your token is placed on it. You are handed a fair six-sided die and 
three coins. You are allowed to place the coins on three different (nonzero) spaces. Once placed, the coins may not be moved.
After placing the three coins, you roll the die and move your token forward the appropriate number of spaces. 
If, after moving the token, it lands on a space with a coin on it, you are freed. If not, you roll again and continue moving 
forward. If your token passes all three coins without landing on one, you are executed. On which three spaces should 
you place the coins to maximize your chances of survival?
